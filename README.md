The purpose of this study is to design and implement a lightweight control system and remote
interface to convert a commercially available helium balloon into a fully functional blimp. This
research aims to explore how custom-designed hardware and software can transform an ordinary
inflatable structure into a maneuverable LTA vehicle, The study seeks to address key challenges
in stability, control precision, and propulsion by developing a custom motor driver, optimizing
PID-based stabilization, and minimizing latency issues using a custom-built remote controller.
